#Project 2: BUILD AN APARTMENT 

**Name:** Rich Barr

**Time to complete project:** +50 hours 

**Enjoyed:** Experimenting with different lighting techniques and textures.

**Challenging:** 
Figuring out how to swap the teleport function for a basic autowalk function. 
Fixing the clock so that it tells the correct time. I eventually found a script to do this, but wasn't sure how to synchronize the ticking with the motion of the second hand.
Getting the supplied Apartment material to work with the models. Tweaking the tiling and offset parameters didn't achieve the desired results and I ended up creating my own materials for most of the props.

**Notes**
I've included the GoogleVR folder in the assets because of the addition of the autowalk script. 
I've left a static camera in the scene so the FPS controller can be deactivated and teleport script renabled if necesssary.
There were some strange discrepencies between the Unity and Mobile views for certain shaders and materials. I found that what looked great onscreen did not always translate well once the app was built, so lots of trial and error was involved in the making of this project. As an example, the lamp shades and painting are much brighter when the app is running on the Google Pixel compared to the Unity game view.

App built with Unity 5.5.0f3 using the gvr-unity-sdk-1.0.3 and tested on the Google Pixel XL
